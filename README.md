The Standard Calculator in Java is a basic command-line application designed to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built using the Java programming language, this project demonstrates the use of user input handling, basic control flow, and simple mathematical calculations. The calculator prompts the user to select an operation and enter two numerical values, then processes the input and displays the result.

This project uses the Scanner class for capturing user input from the console, and a switch statement to handle different operations based on the user's choice. Basic error handling is implemented to avoid division by zero, ensuring the program doesn’t crash when an invalid operation is attempted. The calculator is a simple yet effective demonstration of Java’s capabilities for handling user input, performing arithmetic operations, and providing immediate feedback. This project is ideal for beginners who are learning Java basics like control structures, input/output handling, and basic arithmetic.
